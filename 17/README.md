YESSSSS!!!!
It took a couple of days but I have officially gotten my laravel site up on aws
using sail! so stoked!
Alright, so what did I learn? I need to make sure I have the right sized ec2
server because it bit me two days in a row to have a server that was too small.
I still need to do a couple days more of launching and testing to make sure it's
stuck in my head but I'm glad I got it done! I've added the histroy from my
server to the folder, so that's there.
