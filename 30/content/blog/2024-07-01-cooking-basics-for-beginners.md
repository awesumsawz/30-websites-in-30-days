# Cooking Basics for Beginners

Learning to cook is one of the most rewarding skills you can develop. Not only does it allow you to create delicious meals tailored to your preferences, but it also saves money and promotes healthier eating habits.

## Essential Kitchen Tools

You don't need expensive equipment to start cooking great meals. Here are the basics:

- A good chef's knife
- Cutting board
- Measuring cups and spoons
- Mixing bowls
- Skillet/frying pan
- Saucepan
- Baking sheet

## Fundamental Techniques

Master these techniques and you'll be prepared for countless recipes:

### 1. Knife Skills

Learning how to safely and efficiently chop, dice, and mince is foundational. Start with larger cuts and work your way to more precise ones as you gain confidence.

### 2. Understanding Heat

Knowing when to use high heat versus low and slow cooking makes all the difference:
- High heat: Searing, stir-frying
- Medium heat: Most sautéing, pancakes
- Low heat: Simmering sauces, delicate proteins

### 3. Seasoning

Remember to taste as you go and adjust seasonings. Salt isn't just for flavor—it enhances other ingredients and can transform a dish.

## Simple Recipe to Try

- 8 oz pasta of your choice

- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- Red pepper flakes (optional)
