# 5 Productivity Hacks That Actually Work

In a world full of distractions, maintaining productivity can be challenging. Here are five science-backed strategies that can help you accomplish more without burning out.

## 1. Time Blocking

Instead of a traditional to-do list, schedule specific blocks of time for different tasks:

- **Deep work blocks**: 90-120 minute periods for focused, challenging work
- **Shallow work blocks**: Shorter periods for emails, calls, and admin tasks
- **Buffer blocks**: Small gaps between tasks to account for overruns and transitions

This approach aligns your intentions with your calendar, making you more likely to follow through.

## 2. The Pomodoro Technique

This time-management method involves:

1. Choose a task
2. Work for 25 minutes (one "Pomodoro")
3. Take a 5-minute break
4. After four Pomodoros, take a longer 15-30 minute break

The technique leverages our natural attention spans while providing regular recovery periods.

## 3. The Two-Minute Rule

If a task takes less than two minutes to complete, do it immediately rather than scheduling it for later. This prevents small tasks from piling up and reduces decision fatigue.

## 4. Batching Similar Tasks

Group similar tasks together and complete them in one session:

- Process all emails during designated times
- Make all phone calls back-to-back
- Prepare social media content in batches

This reduces the mental cost of context switching.

## 5. Strategic Incompletion

Sometimes, deliberately stopping work mid-task at the end of the day can make it easier to get started the next morning. This technique, sometimes called the "Hemingway Bridge," takes advantage of our brain's desire for completion.
