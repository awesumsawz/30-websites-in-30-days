# Welcome to day one.

I walked downstairs at about 7:30pm to start this thing. It's now 7:55pm and 
I've only just begun. I think the goal for today is a three page website (home, 
about, contact) with the most simplistic design possible. I've not done much 
work with tailwind to this point so I'm going to set my sights on that for 
styles. I also setup the project with react and typescript so more opportunity 
to practice there as well. This is my second laravel site so I'm hoping that 
will help get me to the finish line.

Deadline: midnight. Hopefully sooner. I'd like to watch a show or something 
before I have to go to sleep.

Additional challenges: today is my first day using homerow mods. It's going to
be a journey.

Let's get started.

--------------------------------

note: this is round 2. I installed too much before. no inertia or breeze this
time. just a vanilla laravel install.

--------------------------------

End time: 10:30pm

Had several bumps but got it done. it's rough. I need to get better at tailwind. I 
also need to become more familiar with controllers as well. I had to lean heavily 
on cursor to build out the contact page. I didn't even style it either. Hit a wall 
and calling it before styling the contact page.
