# 30 Days of Websites

## What is this?

I've realized that I've let myself fall behind, reliant on my ability to build
longterm projects. So, I've resolved to build. I need volume. I need exposure 
and experience. I need to be able to build quickly and efficiently. And this is
my solution. I'm going to build a website every day for 30 days. If I can, I'll
keep going after that.

## Rules

1. A website must be built every day.
2. To be considered complete, the website must have at least three pages that a  
    user can navigate between.
3. The quality doesn't matter (although it would be nice to have something that)
    looks reasonable at the end)
4. The website can use components built from previous days or projects
5. Although the entire site can't be copied from previous projects or templates,
    I'm allowed whatever shortcuts I can find (I'm going for volume and speed)
6. Daily logs must be kept in the README.md file in the project folder
    a. Log the start time and end time 
    b. Log any technology choices made at the start of the day
    c. Log experiences and challenges throughout the day
7. The project must be pushed to github every day
8. While AI can be used, it is prohibited from being the primary focus of the
    project. The goal is to build websites with my brain, not a machine's.
9. A website can be returned to during the project if it is built from scratch
    again. This puts emphasis on the building process, learning, and a touch of
    dopemining

### Day Six - 02-24-2025

Today succcccked. keyboard being weird. wiped out a bunch of work after several
hours. not a great day. Had to start over after several hours of work. I was
working on my thinkbig.dev site but I'm not going to be able to finish it today.
Still going to get a site built but it's not what I wanted.



--------------------------------

### Day Five - 02-23-2025

Continuing the focus on NextJS. Going to work on more database interactions with
Prisma and Typescript. More tailwindcss for styling.

Start: 7:30pm
break: 8:00pm
resume: 9:00pm
end: 10:00pm

Working on tailwind today. Started with V0 but it didn't do a great job of
building out the theme. However, I was able to get it fixed up with some
adjustments. I'm starting to feel more comfortable with the tailwind syntax. I 
learned a lot about flex and grid today and how it's applied in tailwind.
I also did some work on taking notes in the root dir for how to get a project
up and running more proficiently.

--------------------------------

### Day Four - 02-22-2025

Today I'm back with NextJS. I liked working on the project from yesterday, so 
I'm continuing on with that. I'll emphasize the build process today and try to
get further into typescript to build out dynamic components.

start: 4:00pm
break: 5pm
resume: 8:30pm
end: 10pm

Relied pretty heavily on ai today to get things rolling. Thought was that I'd
prefer to have something written for me to reference tomorrow. So I built the 
UI using v0. Then I had cursor build out the prisma factory and incorportate it
into the backlog page. No super proud or happy with how things turned out but I
think I'm starting to understand and feel a bit more comfortable with how NextJS
is structured. 

--------------------------------

### Day Three - 02-21-2025

Today I'm going to focus back on nextjs. 

I'd like to build a self-hosted ticket
system like jira but for small projects. I don't work with a team but I really
like using ticketing systems to track progress. I'm going to try to build a 
simple version of that today. 

Css with tailwind today.

Typescript for the js.

pnpm (based on a theo video from yesterday) for the package manager.

Let's do this.

Start: 4pm

Using V0 for the first time to build my UI. I'd like to focus on getting into
the typescript of the project rather than focusing on just getting the page
built. 

break: 5:00pm -- dinner
resume: 8pm
End: 9:30pm

Getting stuff going today was rough. Integrating with v0 proved more confusing
than I'd anticipated. I hope to bring down the time to start variable as time
continues. I really enjoyed using v0 though! I really liked just moving past the
design phase and jumping into code that I was able to interact with right away.
I'm still figuring out typescript. It feels a lot like js with extra hurdles
right now. I hope to start to see the appeal as time goes on but for now it 
seems like more of a hassle than a help.

I also really liked the project idea for today. I feel like having a ticketing
system for personal and solo projects would be really helpful. It'd also be nice
to be able to put something open source out into the world to have real world
impacts.

We'll see what tomorrow brings but I think I'd like to return to this concept
again tomorrow with a fresh start. I want to get more into the thought side of
the project sooner than later. I like flexing my brain muscles every now and 
then just to prove that I can!

--------------------------------

### Day Two - 02-20-2025

Today it's time for nextjs again. I've built a project with it once before but
I could certainly use more experience. I'm also including tailwind again, it was
interesting to build in and I certainly see the value in adding styles from the
front end interfaces. I'm also going to be implementing typescript as my js 
direction of choice. It's another thing that I could use more experience with
since generally my wp projects are in php and vanilla js. I'm also including
app router and bun in the project. Bun is new and very unfamiliar. App router 
is less foreign.

let's get started.

Start: 4:41pm
break: 5:00pm -- sick kid and dinner
resume: 7:42pm
End: 9:00pm

Rough time to start a challenge. Daughter is sick and I'm just recovering from
being sick myself. I got the site to meet my most basic requirements. I have 
three seperate views. I have a header. I have margin around the content. I 
believe that qualifies as a website. I'm hoping I get better at getting projects
started. Most of my time was just getting the project setup. I felt like the 
nextjs basics made sense and seemed vaguely familiar. The project basics seem to
have changed since I last put my hands on it but overall it was easy enough to
get the ball rolling. I'm also building some fondness for tailwind. Once things
start to click, it becomes easier. I just need to figure out how to get to the 
clicking part with the rest of the element specs.

Looking forward to trying another nextjs project tomorrow. I liked the business
idea I went with for this one. I'm interested in carrying that one forward for
some time.

--------------------------------

### Day One - 02-19-2025

I walked downstairs at about 7:30pm to start this thing. It's now 7:55pm and 
I've only just begun. I think the goal for today is a three page website (home, 
about, contact) with the most simplistic design possible. I've not done much 
work with tailwind to this point so I'm going to set my sights on that for 
styles. I also setup the project with react and typescript so more opportunity 
to practice there as well. This is my second laravel site so I'm hoping that 
will help get me to the finish line.

Deadline: midnight. Hopefully sooner. I'd like to watch a show or something 
before I have to go to sleep.

Additional challenges: today is my first day using homerow mods. It's going to
be a journey.

Let's get started.

note: this is round 2. I installed too much before. no inertia or breeze this
time. just a vanilla laravel install.

End time: 10:30pm

Had several bumps but got it done. it's rough. I need to get better at tailwind. I 
also need to become more familiar with controllers as well. I had to lean heavily 
on cursor to build out the contact page. I didn't even style it either. Hit a wall 
and calling it before styling the contact page.
