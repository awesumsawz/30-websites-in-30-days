# 30 Days of Websites

## What is this?

I've realized that I've let myself fall behind, reliant on my ability to build
longterm projects. So, I've resolved to build. I need volume. I need exposure 
and experience. I need to be able to build quickly and efficiently. And this is
my solution. I'm going to build a website every day for 30 days. If I can, I'll
keep going after that.

## Rules

1. A website must be built every day.
2. To be considered complete, the website must have at least three pages that a  
    user can navigate between.
3. The quality doesn't matter (although it would be nice to have something that)
    looks reasonable at the end)
4. The website can use components built from previous days or projects
5. Although the entire site can't be copied from previous projects or templates,
    I'm allowed whatever shortcuts I can find (I'm going for volume and speed)
6. Daily logs must be kept in the README.md file in the project folder
    a. Log the start time and end time 
    b. Log any technology choices made at the start of the day
    c. Log experiences and challenges throughout the day
7. The project must be pushed to github every day

### Day Three - 02-21-2025

Today I'm going to focus back on nextjs. 

I'd like to build a self-hosted ticket
system like jira but for small projects. I don't work with a team but I really
like using ticketing systems to track progress. I'm going to try to build a 
simple version of that today. 

Css with tailwind today.

Typescript for the js.

pnpm (based on a theo video from yesterday) for the package manager.

Let's do this.

Start time: 4pm
--------------------------------


### Day Two - 02-20-2025

Today it's time for nextjs again. I've built a project with it once before but
I could certainly use more experience. I'm also including tailwind again, it was
interesting to build in and I certainly see the value in adding styles from the
front end interfaces. I'm also going to be implementing typescript as my js 
direction of choice. It's another thing that I could use more experience with
since generally my wp projects are in php and vanilla js. I'm also including
app router and bun in the project. Bun is new and very unfamiliar. App router 
is less foreign.

let's get started.

Start time: 4:41pm
--------------------------------
break time: 5:00pm -- sick kid and dinner
--------------------------------
resume: 7:42pm
--------------------------------
End time: 9:00pm

Rough time to start a challenge. Daughter is sick and I'm just recovering from
being sick myself. I got the site to meet my most basic requirements. I have 
three seperate views. I have a header. I have margin around the content. I 
believe that qualifies as a website. I'm hoping I get better at getting projects
started. Most of my time was just getting the project setup. I felt like the 
nextjs basics made sense and seemed vaguely familiar. The project basics seem to
have changed since I last put my hands on it but overall it was easy enough to
get the ball rolling. I'm also building some fondness for tailwind. Once things
start to click, it becomes easier. I just need to figure out how to get to the 
clicking part with the rest of the element specs.

Looking forward to trying another nextjs project tomorrow. I liked the business
idea I went with for this one. I'm interested in carrying that one forward for
some time.


### Day One - 02-19-2025

I walked downstairs at about 7:30pm to start this thing. It's now 7:55pm and 
I've only just begun. I think the goal for today is a three page website (home, 
about, contact) with the most simplistic design possible. I've not done much 
work with tailwind to this point so I'm going to set my sights on that for 
styles. I also setup the project with react and typescript so more opportunity 
to practice there as well. This is my second laravel site so I'm hoping that 
will help get me to the finish line.

Deadline: midnight. Hopefully sooner. I'd like to watch a show or something 
before I have to go to sleep.

Additional challenges: today is my first day using homerow mods. It's going to
be a journey.

Let's get started.

--------------------------------

note: this is round 2. I installed too much before. no inertia or breeze this
time. just a vanilla laravel install.

--------------------------------

End time: 10:30pm

Had several bumps but got it done. it's rough. I need to get better at tailwind. I 
also need to become more familiar with controllers as well. I had to lean heavily 
on cursor to build out the contact page. I didn't even style it either. Hit a wall 
and calling it before styling the contact page.
